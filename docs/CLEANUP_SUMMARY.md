# Repository Cleanup & Documentation Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Repository Organization

**Before:**
- 40+ progress tracking files scattered in root directory
- Mixed documentation, planning, and achievement files
- Binary files (connect, disconnect) in root
- Unclear structure for newcomers

**After:**
- Clean root with only essential files
- Organized documentation in `docs/` hierarchy
- Archived development history in `docs/development/`
- Clear separation of concerns

### 2. Documentation Structure

```

│   └── websocket-api.md   # Complete WebSocket API reference
├── deployment/            # Deployment guides
│   └── README.md         # Production deployment guide
├── guides/               # Development guides
│   └── development.md    # Contributing and dev setup
├── development/          # Development history
│   ├── achievement/      # 9-hour achievement records
│   ├── planning/         # Sprint planning documents
