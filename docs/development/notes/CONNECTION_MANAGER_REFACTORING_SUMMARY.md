# Connection Manager Interface and Mock Refactoring Summary

## Overview

We successfully refactored the WebSocket connection management system to follow the patterns outlined in `CENTRALIZED_MOCKS.md`, creating a clean interface-based architecture that improves testability and eliminates mock duplication.

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Created ConnectionManager Interface (`interfaces.go`)
```go
type ConnectionManager interface {
    Send(ctx context.Context, connectionID string, message interface{}) error
    Broadcast(ctx context.Context, connectionIDs []string, message interface{}) error
    IsActive(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) bool
    GetMetrics() map[string]interface{}
    Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
    SetLogger(logger func(format string, args ...interface{}))
}
```

### 2. Consolidated All Mocks (`mocks.go`)
- Removed duplicate files: `mock.go`, `mock_testify.go`, `mocks.go` (old)
- Created a single `mocks.go` with:
  - **MockConnectionManager**: Manual mock with function fields
  - **MockConnectionManagerTestify**: Testify-based mock
  - **MockAPIGatewayClient**: Testify-based API Gateway mock
  - **TestableAPIGatewayClient**: Configurable mock for complex scenarios

### 3. Updated Dependencies

#### Manager.go
- Changed from concrete AWS SDK client to `APIGatewayClient` interface
- Constructor now accepts interface: `NewManager(store, apiGateway APIGatewayClient, endpoint)`

#### Executor.go
- Changed from concrete `*connection.Manager` to `ConnectionManager` interface
- Constructor now accepts interface: `New(connManager ConnectionManager, requestQueue, logger)`

### 4. Fixed All Tests
- Updated executor tests to use `connection.NewMockConnectionManager()`
- Changed from testify `On()` style to function field assignment:
  ```go
  mockConnMgr.SendFunc = func(ctx context.Context, connectionID string, message interface{}) error {
      return nil
  }
  ```

## Benefits

1. **No More Type Casting Issues**: Tests no longer need to cast mocks to concrete types
2. **Centralized Mocks**: All mock types in one place, following consistent patterns
3. **Better Testability**: Interface-based design allows easy mocking
4. **AWS SDK Isolation**: Production code is decoupled from AWS SDK types
5. **Multiple Mock Styles**: Support for both manual and testify-based mocking

## Test Results

- ✅ All executor tests passing
- ✅ All connection package tests passing
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Mock consolidation complete

## Architecture Alignment

The refactoring aligns perfectly with `CENTRALIZED_MOCKS.md`:
- Interfaces abstract AWS operations
- Production adapter wraps real AWS SDK
- Multiple mock implementations for different testing needs
- Clear separation between production and test code

## CloudWatch Note

As requested, CloudWatch metrics testing was skipped due to AWS SDK v2's concrete type requirements. The focus was on WebSocket connection management, which is now fully testable.
