2. **internal/protocol**: 98.6% (already excellent)
3. **pkg/streamer**: 97.8% (improved from 21.1%)
4. **pkg/progress**: 95.1% (improved from 0%, has 1 failing test)
5. **lambda/processor/executor**: 90.1% (improved from 0%)
6. **internal/store/dynamorm**: 84.0% (maintained)
7. **internal/store**: 80.8% (improved from 29.9%)

### 🔄 In Progress Packages (60-80% Coverage)
8. **pkg/connection**: 67.8% (improved from 33.8%) ⬅️ **LATEST UPDATE**

### 📋 Remaining Packages (<80% Coverage)
- **lambda/connect**: 65.2% (has failing tests)
- **lambda/disconnect**: 70.1%
- **lambda/processor/handlers**: 62.3%
- **lambda/router**: 53.3%
- **lambda/shared**: 54.7%

## Latest Progress: pkg/connection Package

### Coverage Improvement
- **Before**: 33.8%
- **After**: 67.8%
- **Improvement**: +34.0%

### Key Testing Additions
1. **Manager Edge Cases**:
   - NewManager initialization validation
   - SetLogger functionality
   - Shutdown scenarios (graceful, timeout, send-after-shutdown)

2. **Circuit Breaker Testing**:
   - Circuit breaker opens after failures
   - Circuit breaker resets after timeout
   - Success resets failure counters
   - CountOpen functionality

3. **Retry Logic Testing**:
   - Retry on retryable errors (ThrottlingError)
   - No retry on non-retryable errors (ForbiddenError)
   - Context cancellation during retries

4. **IsActive Edge Cases**:
   - Stale connection ping testing
   - Ping test failures
   - Circuit breaker preventing checks

5. **Broadcast Edge Cases**:
   - Empty connection lists
   - Marshal errors
   - Shutdown during processing

6. **Advanced Component Testing**:
   - LatencyTracker percentile calculations
   - Sample limit enforcement
   - Metrics collection validation

### Technical Patterns Established
- **Error Type Testing**: Comprehensive coverage of custom error types
- **Async Operation Testing**: Proper handling of goroutines and timeouts
- **Mock Expectations**: Using `.Maybe()` for async operations
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: State management and timeout handling
- **Metrics Validation**: Ensuring proper metric collection

### Remaining Work for pkg/connection
To reach 80% coverage, we need to address:
- **API Gateway Adapter**: 0% coverage (actual implementation, not interface)
- **Testing utilities**: Some functions in testing.go
- **Error conversion**: convertError function

**Estimated effort**: ~1 hour to reach 80%

## Time Investment Summary
- **Phase 1 (pkg/types)**: 30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (pkg/streamer)**: 1.5 hours  
- **Phase 3 (pkg/progress)**: 1 hour
- **Phase 4 (lambda/processor/executor)**: 1.5 hours
- **Phase 5 (internal/store)**: 1 hour
- **Phase 6 (pkg/connection)**: 1.5 hours ⬅️ **NEW**
- **Total Time**: ~6.5 hours

## Testing Patterns & Best Practices

### Established Patterns
1. **Table-Driven Tests**: Consistent structure across packages
2. **Interface-Based Mocking**: Using testify/mock for clean separation
3. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Comprehensive error path testing
4. **WebSocket Testing**: Following Lift's testing guide patterns
5. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of goroutines and timeouts
6. **Circuit Breaker Testing**: State management validation
7. **Metrics Testing**: Performance metric collection validation

### Lift Integration Testing
- **Lift v1.0.11**: Successfully integrated and tested
- **AWS Service Mocking**: Using Lift's built-in mocks
- **WebSocket Patterns**: Following Lift's testing documentation
- **Error Handling**: Lift-compatible error types and interfaces

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 2-3 hours)
1. **Complete pkg/connection**: Add API Gateway Adapter tests to reach 80%
2. **Fix failing tests**: Address lambda/connect and pkg/progress test failures
3. **Lambda handlers**: Focus on lambda/processor/handlers, lambda/router, lambda/shared

### Target Packages for 80%
- **lambda/disconnect**: 70.1% → 80% (needs +9.9%)
- **lambda/connect**: 65.2% → 80% (needs +14.8%, fix failing tests)
- **lambda/processor/handlers**: 62.3% → 80% (needs +17.7%)

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization
Once 80% coverage is achieved:
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory optimization
- Cold start improvements
- Bundle size optimization

## Success Metrics
- ✅ **7 packages** now exceed 80% coverage target
- ✅ **Overall coverage**: 67.1% (from 16.8%)
- ✅ **Testing patterns**: Established and documented
- ✅ **Lift integration**: Successfully tested
- 🔄 **Target**: 80% overall coverage (need +12.9%)
