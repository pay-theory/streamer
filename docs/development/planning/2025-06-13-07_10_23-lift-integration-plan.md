# Streamer + Lift Integration Plan

**Date:** 2025-06-13-07_10_23  
**Sprint:** Lift Integration Sprint (7 days)  
**Teams:** Streamer Team + Lift Team Collaboration  
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the integration of Pay Theory's Lift framework into the Streamer WebSocket management system. The integration will modernize our lambda architecture, reduce boilerplate code by 35%, and improve cold start performance by 40%.

## Project Goals

1. **Replace manual lambda handling** with Lift's standardized framework
2. **Unify HTTP and WebSocket** request processing
3. **Implement comprehensive observability** with built-in Lift features
4. **Reduce operational complexity** through Lift's middleware stack
5. **Establish performance baselines** and demonstrate improvements

## Architecture Overview

### Current State
- 4 separate lambda functions with manual initialization
- Custom error handling and logging in each function
- No unified middleware or observability
- Manual JWT validation and context propagation

### Target State
- Lift-powered lambdas with standardized initialization
- Unified middleware stack across all functions
- Built-in observability, metrics, and tracing
- Automatic context propagation and error handling

## Integration Approach

### Phase 1: Baseline and Foundation (Days 0-1)
- Collect comprehensive baseline metrics
- Set up Lift dependencies and core packages
- Create integration adapters

### Phase 2: Lambda Migration (Days 2-4)
- Migrate Connect handler to Lift
- Migrate Disconnect handler to Lift
- Migrate Router handler to Lift
- Migrate Processor handler to Lift

### Phase 3: Testing and Optimization (Days 5-6)
- Comprehensive integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation updates

### Phase 4: Deployment and Validation (Day 7)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Collect post-integration metrics
- Create comparison report

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Cold Start: 40% reduction (from ~500ms to <300ms)
- Warm Latency: 20% improvement
- Bundle Size: 30% reduction
- Memory Usage: 15% reduction

### Code Quality Targets
- Lines of Code: 35% reduction in boilerplate
- Complexity: 25% reduction in cyclomatic complexity
- Test Coverage: Maintain or improve current levels
- Error Rates: Zero increase

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **WebSocket Compatibility**: Mitigated by custom adapters
2. **Performance Regression**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing
3. **Breaking Changes**: Mitigated by no backward compatibility requirements

### Schedule Risks
1. **Complexity Underestimation**: Mitigated by Lift team support
2. **Testing Delays**: Mitigated by parallel test development
3. **Deployment Issues**: Mitigated by staging validation

## Team Responsibilities

### Streamer Team
- Lead implementation effort
- Maintain business logic integrity
- Conduct testing and validation
- Document changes

### Lift Team
- Provide implementation guidance
- Review integration patterns
- Assist with optimization
- Support troubleshooting

## Communication Plan

- **Daily Standups**: 9 AM - Progress and blockers
- **Lift Office Hours**: 2-4 PM - Direct support
- **End of Day Reports**: Document progress and decisions
- **Slack Channel**: #streamer-lift-integration

## Definition of Done

1. All 4 lambdas successfully migrated to Lift
2. All tests passing with â‰¥80% coverage
3. Performance metrics meet or exceed targets
4. Documentation complete and reviewed
5. Deployed to staging environment
6. Comparison report published

## Next Steps

1. Review this plan with both teams
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Day 0 baseline collection
4. Schedule kick-off meeting with Lift team
