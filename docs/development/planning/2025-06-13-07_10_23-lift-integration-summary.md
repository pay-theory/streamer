## Quick Start Guide

### Day 0: Baseline Collection
1. Use the baseline metrics AI prompt
2. Run TASK-001 and TASK-002
3. Document all metrics in `metrics/baseline/`

### Days 1-4: Implementation
1. Follow the task breakdown sequentially
2. Use the lambda migration AI prompt
3. Complete daily standups and progress reports

### Days 5-7: Validation
1. Use the testing/optimization AI prompt
2. Execute comprehensive testing (TASK-013)
3. Deploy to staging and collect final metrics

## Key Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Cold Start**: 40% reduction (500ms → <300ms)
- **Warm Latency**: 20% improvement
- **Bundle Size**: 30% reduction
- **Memory Usage**: 15% reduction

### Code Quality Targets
- **Lines of Code**: 35% reduction in boilerplate
