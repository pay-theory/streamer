# Team Coordination Plan for Streamer Project

## Overview
This document outlines how Team 1 (Infrastructure) and Team 2 (Application) will coordinate their efforts to build Streamer efficiently while minimizing dependencies and maximizing parallel work.

## Week-by-Week Coordination

### Week 1: Foundation & Planning
**Team 1**: Storage Layer Implementation
- Define and implement core models (Connection, AsyncRequest, Subscription)
- Create storage interfaces with clear contracts
- Share interface definitions with Team 2 by Day 2

**Team 2**: Design & Architecture
- Design Router and Handler interfaces
- Create request/response type definitions
- Plan handler registry architecture
- Review Team 1's storage interfaces and provide feedback

**Sync Points**:
- Day 2: Share storage interfaces for review
- Day 4: Finalize data models and interfaces
- Day 5: Integration planning session

### Week 2: Building Core Components
**Team 1**: Lambda Functions
- Implement connection/disconnection handlers
- Use storage layer from Week 1
- Create Lambda deployment configurations

**Team 2**: Router Implementation
- Build router using agreed interfaces
- Implement sync request processing
- Mock storage layer for testing

**Sync Points**:
- Daily: 15-minute standup for blockers
- Mid-week: API contract review
- End of week: Integration test planning

### Week 3-4: Integration Phase
**Team 1**: Production Features
- Add monitoring and metrics
- Implement DynamoDB Streams configuration
- Performance optimization

**Team 2**: Async Processing
- Build stream processor
- Implement progress reporting
- Real-time WebSocket updates

**Sync Points**:
- Week 3 Start: End-to-end integration test
- Daily: Debugging sessions as needed
- Week 4 End: Performance testing together

### Interface Contracts

#### Storage Interfaces (Team 1 provides, Team 2 consumes)
```go
// internal/store/interfaces.go
type ConnectionStore interface {
    Save(ctx context.Context, conn *Connection) error
    Get(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) (*Connection, error)
    Delete(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) error
    ListByUser(ctx context.Context, userID string) ([]*Connection, error)
    ListByTenant(ctx context.Context, tenantID string) ([]*Connection, error)
    UpdateLastPing(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) error
}

type RequestQueue interface {
    Enqueue(ctx context.Context, req *AsyncRequest) error
    UpdateStatus(ctx context.Context, requestID string, status string, result interface{}) error
    GetByConnection(ctx context.Context, connectionID string) ([]*AsyncRequest, error)
}
```

#### Handler Interfaces (Team 2 provides, Team 1 implements Lambda integration)
```go
// pkg/streamer/handler.go
type Handler interface {
    Validate(request *Request) error
    EstimatedDuration() time.Duration
    Process(ctx context.Context, request *Request) (*Result, error)
}
```

### Communication Channels

1. **Slack Channels**
   - `#streamer-dev` - General development discussion
   - `#streamer-integration` - Integration issues
   - `#streamer-standup` - Daily updates

2. **Meetings**
   - Daily: 15-min standup (async allowed)
   - Weekly: 1-hour architecture review
   - Bi-weekly: Sprint planning

3. **Documentation**
   - Shared Google Doc for design decisions
   - GitHub Wiki for implementation details
   - README files in each package

### Dependency Management

#### Week 1-2: Minimal Dependencies
- Team 2 uses interface mocks
- Team 1 focuses on storage implementation
- Both teams can work independently

#### Week 3-4: Integration Points
- Shared testing environment
- Joint debugging sessions
- Performance testing collaboration

#### Week 5+: Full Integration
- End-to-end testing
- Production deployment planning
- Monitoring setup

## Conflict Resolution

### Code Conflicts
1. Each team owns specific packages
2. Shared packages require PR review from both teams
3. Architecture changes need consensus

### Technical Disagreements
1. Document options with pros/cons
2. POC implementation if needed
3. Escalate to tech lead if no consensus

### Schedule Conflicts
1. Identify dependencies early
2. Buffer time in estimates
3. Daily communication about blockers

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Each team maintains >90% coverage for their packages
- Shared test utilities in `tests/helpers/`

### Integration Tests
- Joint ownership of integration tests
- Weekly integration test runs
- Shared test data and fixtures

### End-to-End Tests
- Both teams contribute scenarios
- Automated E2E suite in CI/CD
- Performance benchmarks

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Interface mismatch between teams
  - **Mitigation**: Early interface review, shared types package

- **Risk**: Performance bottlenecks at integration
  - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing, profiling tools

- **Risk**: Deployment complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Infrastructure as code, automated deployment

### Process Risks
- **Risk**: Communication breakdown
  - **Mitigation**: Daily standups, clear ownership

- **Risk**: Scope creep
  - **Mitigation**: Strict sprint goals, change control

- **Risk**: Testing gaps
  - **Mitigation**: Shared test strategy, coverage requirements

## Tools & Resources

### Development Tools
- **IDE**: VS Code with Go extensions
- **Version Control**: Git with feature branches
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Local Testing**: LocalStack for AWS services

### Monitoring Tools
- **Logs**: CloudWatch Logs with structured logging
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch Metrics + Dashboards
- **Tracing**: AWS X-Ray
- **Alerts**: CloudWatch Alarms + PagerDuty

### Documentation Tools

- **User Docs**: MkDocs

## Conclusion

This coordination plan ensures both teams can work efficiently in parallel while maintaining alignment on shared goals. Regular communication, clear ownership, and well-defined interfaces are key to success. The plan should be treated as a living document and updated as the project evolves.
