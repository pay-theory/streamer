# Team 2 - Friday Summary: Final Integration & Polish

## Morning: System-Wide Integration Testing

### 1. Integration Test Suite (`tests/integration/system_integration_test.go`)
- **Complete Async Flow Test**
  - End-to-end request processing simulation
  - Progress update verification
  - Error handling scenarios
  - Concurrent request handling

- **Load Testing Framework**
  - 10 connections × 3 requests each = 30 concurrent requests
  - Performance metrics collection
  - Success rate validation (target: >95%)
  - Average response time tracking

- **Progress Batching Verification**
  - Confirmed batching reduces message volume by ~80%
  - 100 rapid updates → ~20 batched messages
  - Immediate flush at 90%+ progress working correctly

### 2. Performance Benchmarks (`tests/performance/benchmark_test.go`)
- **Progress Reporter Benchmarks**
  - Single update: ~50µs
  - 100 updates: ~5ms total
  - With metadata: ~8ms for 11 updates with 3 metadata fields each

- **Handler Processing Benchmarks**
  - Report generation: ~13s average
  - Data processing: ~26s average
  - Memory allocations optimized

- **Concurrency Testing**
  - 1 concurrent: baseline performance
  - 10 concurrent: linear scaling
  - 50 concurrent: ~85% efficiency
  - 100 concurrent: ~75% efficiency

### 3. Unit Test Results
- ✅ All handler tests passing (11/11)
