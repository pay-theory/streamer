# Streamer Project Summary

## What is Streamer?

Streamer is a Go library that solves the critical challenge of handling long-running operations in AWS Lambda where API Gateway enforces a 29-second timeout. It provides:

- **Async request processing** with DynamoDB queuing
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket connections
- **Progress tracking** for long-running operations
- **Seamless integration** with DynamORM for data persistence

## Documentation Overview

We've created comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of the project:

### 1. [README.md](README.md)
The main entry point providing:
- Project overview and core architecture
- Integration with DynamORM
- Quick start guide with code examples
- Use cases and roadmap

### 2. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
Deep dive into system design:
- Component breakdown (Connection Manager, Router, Processor)
- Data models and table schemas
- Scalability and reliability patterns
- Security considerations
- Performance optimizations

### 3. [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
Complete repository layout:
- Directory structure with detailed descriptions
- Implementation phases (12 weeks)
- Development guidelines
- CI/CD and release process

### 4. [TECHNICAL_SPEC.md](TECHNICAL_SPEC.md)
Implementation details:
- Core interfaces and types
- Message protocol specification
- Lambda function implementations
- Testing strategy
- Deployment templates

### 5. [IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md](IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
Step-by-step development plan:
- 12 sprints with clear goals
- Task breakdowns and deliverables
- Success metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Two-Lambda Pattern
- **Router Lambda**: Fast response, queues long requests
- **Processor Lambda**: Handles async work via DynamoDB Streams

### 2. DynamoDB for Everything
- Connection persistence
- Request queuing
- Progress tracking
- Automatic cleanup with TTL

### 3. DynamORM Integration
- Type-safe models
- Optimized queries
- Lambda-aware features
- Multi-tenant support

## Implementation Timeline

**Total Duration**: 12 weeks

1. **Weeks 1-2**: Core infrastructure and storage
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Connection management and routing
3. **Weeks 5-6**: Async processing and real-time updates
4. **Weeks 7-8**: Production features and monitoring
5. **Weeks 9-10**: Client SDKs and examples
6. **Weeks 11-12**: Advanced features and launch prep

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- Cold start: < 100ms
- Message latency: < 50ms p99
- Throughput: 10K+ messages/second
- Scale: 100K+ concurrent connections

### Developer Experience
- Time to first message: < 5 minutes
- Complete documentation
- Multiple SDK languages
- Production-ready examples

### Cost Efficiency
- Cost per message: < $0.0001
- Cost per connection-hour: < $0.001
- 80% development time savings

## Next Steps

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Initialize `github.com/pay-theory/streamer`
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure development environment

2. **Start Implementation**
   - Begin with Sprint 1: Core Models & Storage
   - Follow the implementation roadmap
   - Regular testing and documentation

3. **Community Building**
   - Create contribution guidelines
   - Set up issue templates
   - Plan for open source launch

## How Streamer Complements DynamORM

While DynamORM provides the data persistence layer, Streamer adds the real-time communication and async processing capabilities needed for modern serverless applications:

- **DynamORM**: Type-safe DynamoDB operations
- **Streamer**: WebSocket management and async processing
- **Together**: Complete serverless application platform
