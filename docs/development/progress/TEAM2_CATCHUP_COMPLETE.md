# Team 2 Catch-Up Complete âœ…

## What We Fixed

### 1. Progress Reporter Updates âœ…
- Added connection active check before sending updates
- Added proper error handling (don't fail the whole process)
- Added debug logging for all progress messages
- Fixed rate limiting to allow 100% updates through

**File Updated:** `pkg/progress/reporter.go`

### 2. Created Test Handlers âœ…
- Added `echo_async` handler for simple testing
- Registered it in the processor Lambda
- Works with simulated progress updates

**Files Created/Updated:**
- `lambda/processor/handlers/echo_async.go`
- `lambda/processor/main.go`

### 3. Demo Setup âœ…
Created complete demo infrastructure:

**Demo Client:**
- `demo/client.js` - Interactive WebSocket client
- `demo/package.json` - Dependencies
- `demo/README.md` - Clear instructions

**Demo Data Setup:**
- `scripts/demo/main.go` - Creates test connections

**Test Script:**
- `scripts/test_async_flow.sh` - Verifies infrastructure

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build Lambda deployment packages
make build-lambdas

# Deploy with Pulumi (if configured)
cd deployment/pulumi
pulumi up

# Or deploy manually via AWS CLI/Console using the deployment.zip files
```

### 2. Create Test Connection
```bash
cd scripts/demo
go run main.go
# Note the CONNECTION_ID output
```

### 3. Run Demo Client
```bash
cd demo
npm install

export WS_URL="wss://your-api.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod"
export CONNECTION_ID="demo-conn-12345678"  # From step 2

npm start
```

### 4. Test Commands
```
> echo Hello World              # Test sync
> echo_async Testing progress   # Test async with progress
> report                        # Full report generation
```

## Monitoring

### Real-time Logs
```bash
# In separate terminals:
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/router --follow
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/processor --follow
```

### Debug Progress Issues
Look for these log patterns:
- `[Progress] Sending update...` - Progress being sent
- `[Progress] Connection X no longer active` - Connection issues
- `Processing with progress support` - Handler using progress

## Demo Talk Track

### Architecture (1 min)
"Streamer solves the 29-second API Gateway timeout by:
- Using WebSocket for persistent connections
- Queuing long-running requests to DynamoDB
- Processing async via DynamoDB Streams
- Sending real-time progress updates"

### Live Demo (3 min)
1. Show connection: "WebSocket maintains persistent connection..."
2. Sync echo: "Small requests process immediately..."
3. Async echo: "Long requests show progress..." [show progress bar]
4. Report generation: "Complex workflows with multiple stages..."

### Monitoring (30 sec)
"Full observability with CloudWatch metrics, X-Ray tracing, and real-time logs"

## If Demo Fails

### Plan B: Architecture Focus
- Show the code structure
- Explain the async flow
- Show CloudWatch dashboards
- Discuss scaling strategy

### Common Issues & Fixes

**No Progress Updates:**
1. Check connection is active in DynamoDB
2. Verify processor Lambda has WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT env var
3. Look for 410 Gone errors in logs

**Connection Errors:**
1. Verify API Gateway endpoint URL
2. Check Lambda execution role permissions
3. Ensure DynamoDB tables exist

## Deployment Files Created

After running `make build-lambdas`, you'll have:
- `lambda/connect/deployment.zip`
- `lambda/disconnect/deployment.zip`
- `lambda/router/deployment.zip`
- `lambda/processor/deployment.zip`

## Next Steps

1. Build the Lambda packages: `make build-lambdas`
2. Deploy to AWS (via Pulumi or manually)
3. Test the complete flow end-to-end
4. Record a backup demo video
5. Practice the demo talk track
