# Streamer Project Team Setup Summary

> **Week 1 Complete!** ðŸŽ‰ See [PROGRESS_REVIEW_WEEK1.md](./PROGRESS_REVIEW_WEEK1.md)
> 
> **Current Focus**: Week 2 Integration - See [WEEK2_KICKOFF_SUMMARY.md](./WEEK2_KICKOFF_SUMMARY.md)

## Overview
I've created a comprehensive set of prompts and coordination plans to help two teams work efficiently on the Streamer project - an async request processing and WebSocket management system for AWS Lambda.

## Team Structure

### Team 1: Infrastructure & Core Systems
- **Focus**: Storage layer, AWS Lambda integration, production infrastructure
- **Key Deliverables**: DynamoDB models, Lambda functions, monitoring, resilience features
- **Technical Stack**: Go, DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, CloudWatch

### Team 2: Application Layer & Developer Experience  
- **Focus**: Request routing, async processing, real-time updates, client SDKs
- **Key Deliverables**: Router system, async processor, WebSocket notifications, SDKs
- **Technical Stack**: Go, TypeScript, WebSockets, DynamoDB Streams

## Created Resources

### 1. TEAM_PROMPTS.md
Comprehensive mission statements and objectives for each team, including:
- Primary objectives broken down by sprint
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Specific deliverables and success metrics
- Collaboration points between teams

### 2. SPRINT_KICKOFF_PROMPTS.md
Ready-to-use prompts for immediate work, including:
- **Team 1 Sprint 1**: Storage layer implementation with DynamORM
- **Team 2 Sprint 3**: Request router implementation
- **Team 1 Week 2**: Lambda function handlers
- **Team 2 Week 4**: Async processor with progress reporting

### 3. TEAM_COORDINATION_PLAN.md
Detailed coordination strategy covering:
- Week-by-week sync points
- Shared interfaces and contracts
- Communication channels and meetings
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Testing and deployment coordination

## Quick Start Guide

### For Team 1:
1. Start with the Storage Layer prompt in `SPRINT_KICKOFF_PROMPTS.md`
2. Set up DynamORM and create the models
3. Share interfaces with Team 2 by Day 2
4. Begin Lambda function development in Week 2

### For Team 2:
1. Review storage interfaces from Team 1
2. Start with Router Design while Team 1 builds storage
3. Use mocks for storage layer initially
4. Begin Router implementation with the Sprint 3 prompt

## Key Integration Points

1. **Day 2**: Storage interface sharing
2. **Week 2**: API contract finalization
3. **Week 3**: First end-to-end integration
4. **Week 4**: Performance testing together

## Communication Strategy

- **Daily**: 15-minute standups (can be async)
- **Weekly**: Architecture review meetings
- **Channels**: #streamer-dev, #streamer-integration
- **Documentation**: Shared in GitHub Wiki

## Success Criteria

Both teams should aim for:
- 90%+ test coverage
- Sub-100ms response times
- Production-ready code with monitoring
- Comprehensive documentation
- Working examples and SDKs

## Next Steps

1. Both teams should read their respective sections in `TEAM_PROMPTS.md`
2. Team leads should review `TEAM_COORDINATION_PLAN.md`
3. Developers can start immediately with prompts from `SPRINT_KICKOFF_PROMPTS.md`
4. Set up communication channels and schedule first sync meeting

The project is structured to allow maximum parallel work while ensuring smooth integration. Each team has clear ownership areas but will collaborate on shared interfaces and testing.

## Week 2 Update

### New Resources Created
Based on Week 1 progress, I've created additional resources:

1. **PROGRESS_REVIEW_WEEK1.md** - Comprehensive review of both teams' accomplishments
2. **WEEK2_SPRINT_PROMPTS.md** - Updated prompts focusing on integration and Lambda functions  
3. **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Practical guide for connecting Team 1 and Team 2 components
4. **WEEK2_KICKOFF_SUMMARY.md** - Action items, timeline, and success metrics for Week 2

### Week 2 Focus
- **Integration**: Connecting storage layer with router
- **Lambda Functions**: Deploying WebSocket handlers
- **Async Processing**: Building DynamoDB Streams processor
- **End-to-End Testing**: First complete message flow

Both teams have exceeded Week 1 expectations and are ready for the integration phase!
