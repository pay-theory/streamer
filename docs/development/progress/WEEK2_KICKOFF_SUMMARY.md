# Week 2 Kickoff Summary

## 📊 Current Status

### What's Complete ✅
- **Team 1**: Storage layer (models, interfaces, implementations, tests)
- **Team 2**: Router system (80% complete, needs integration)
- **Both**: Clean interfaces, good documentation, ahead of schedule!

### What's Next 🚀
- **Team 1**: Lambda functions + ConnectionManager
- **Team 2**: Complete router integration + Async processor
- **Both**: End-to-end integration and testing

## 📁 New Resources Created

1. **PROGRESS_REVIEW_WEEK1.md** - Detailed review of Week 1 accomplishments
2. **WEEK2_SPRINT_PROMPTS.md** - Specific prompts for Week 2 work
3. **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Step-by-step integration instructions
4. **WEEK2_KICKOFF_SUMMARY.md** - This document

## 🎯 Week 2 Focus Areas

### Team 1: Infrastructure & Core Systems
```
Primary Goals:
1. ConnectionManager implementation (needed by Team 2)
2. Connect/Disconnect Lambda handlers  
3. JWT authentication
4. Lambda deployment configuration
```

### Team 2: Application Layer & Developer Experience
```
Primary Goals:
1. Complete router integration with storage
2. Router Lambda function
3. Async processor with DynamoDB Streams
4. Progress reporting system
```

## 🤝 Critical Integration Points

### Monday (Day 1)
- **Morning**: Review integration guide together
- **Afternoon**: Finalize ConnectionManager interface
- **EOD**: Begin implementation

### Tuesday (Day 2)
- **Team 1**: Deliver ConnectionManager to Team 2
- **Team 2**: Integrate ConnectionManager into router
- **Both**: Run first integration tests

### Wednesday (Day 3)
- **Goal**: First end-to-end message flow working
- **Test**: Connect → Send Request → Process → Receive Response

### Thursday (Day 4)
- **Performance testing**: 1000 concurrent connections
- **Metrics collection**: Latency, throughput, errors

### Friday (Day 5)
- **Demo**: Show complete async request flow with progress
- **Planning**: Identify Week 3 priorities

## 💡 Key Decisions Needed This Week

1. **WebSocket Message Format** - Finalize the exact JSON structure
2. **JWT Token Format** - Agree on claims and validation
3. **Error Response Format** - Standardize error codes and messages
4. **Progress Update Frequency** - Balance between real-time and efficiency

## 🛠️ Development Tips

### For Team 1
- Start with ConnectionManager - Team 2 needs it by Tuesday
- Keep Lambda functions lean for fast cold starts
- Use structured logging from the start
- Test with actual API Gateway Management API early

### For Team 2
- Use the mock ConnectionManager from Integration Guide initially
- Focus on getting router Lambda working first
- Design async processor for batch efficiency
- Plan for connection failures in progress reporting

## 📈 Success Metrics for Week 2

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Integration Tests Passing | 100% | Ensures components work together |
| Message Latency | <50ms p99 | User experience |
| Lambda Cold Start | <100ms | First request performance |
| Concurrent Connections | 1000+ | Scalability validation |
| Progress Update Delivery | <100ms | Real-time feel |

## 🚨 Potential Blockers to Watch

1. **API Gateway Management API permissions** - Set up IAM roles early
2. **DynamoDB Streams configuration** - Enable on AsyncRequest table
3. **Lambda environment variables** - Coordinate naming conventions
4. **WebSocket connection limits** - Plan for connection pooling

## 📝 Action Items

### Both Teams - Monday Morning
