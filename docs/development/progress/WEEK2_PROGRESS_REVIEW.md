## Team 2: Application Layer & Developer Experience

### ✅ Completed This Week

#### Integration Adapters (Mon) ✅
- Created type adapters between router and storage
- RequestQueue adapter fully tested
- Error mapping implemented
- Shared types coordinated with Team 1

#### Router Lambda (Tue) ✅
- Lambda function structure created
- Handler registration system working
- ConnectionManager integrated successfully
- Sync/async routing tested

#### Async Processor Foundation (Wed) 🏗️

- Basic event processing working
- Progress reporter design completed
- Integration with ConnectionManager in progress

### 🏗️ In Progress

#### Progress Reporting System (Wed-Thu)
- Basic reporter implemented
- Rate limiting added
- WebSocket updates working intermittently
- Need to complete batching optimization

#### Async Handler Implementation (Thu)
- ReportHandler partially complete
- Progress tracking works but needs refinement
- Error handling needs improvement

### ⏳ Pending

#### Testing & Optimization (Thu-Fri)
- Integration tests partially written
- Progress batching not yet implemented
- Performance testing delayed
- Demo preparation needed

## 🔄 Integration Status

### ✅ Successfully Integrated
1. **ConnectionManager**: Team 2 using Team 1's implementation
2. **Storage Layer**: Router successfully queuing async requests
3. **Message Formats**: Both teams aligned on WebSocket messages
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error types across teams

### 🏗️ Integration In Progress
1. **Progress Updates**: Connection established but reliability issues
2. **Async Processing**: Basic flow works, needs optimization
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Partial coverage

### 🚨 Current Blockers

#### Team 2 Blockers
1. **DynamoDB Streams Configuration**: Need help with Lambda triggers
2. **Progress Update Reliability**: Some messages not reaching clients
3. **Handler Registry**: Dynamic loading needs refinement
4. **Time Pressure**: Behind schedule on testing

#### Resolution Plan
1. Team 1 to assist with Streams configuration (their expertise)
2. Debug WebSocket delivery issues together
3. Simplify handler registry for now
4. Focus on critical path for demo

## 🎯 Remaining Priorities (By EOD Friday)

### Critical Path for Demo
1. **Fix Progress Updates** (Both teams, 2 hours)
   - Debug WebSocket delivery
   - Ensure reliable message flow
   
2. **Complete One Async Handler** (Team 2, 3 hours)
   - Focus on ReportHandler
   - Basic progress reporting
   - Error handling

3. **End-to-End Test** (Both teams, 2 hours)
   - Connect → Request → Process → Progress → Complete
   - Document any issues

4. **Demo Preparation** (Both teams, 1 hour)
   - Test accounts ready
   - Sample data prepared
   - Backup plan

### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)
- Progress batching optimization
- Additional async handlers
- Performance testing
- Client SDK improvements

---

## 💪 Strengths Observed

### Team 1
- Excellent execution on infrastructure
- Proactive on monitoring/observability
- Great documentation
- Performance optimization mindset

### Team 2
- Good adaptation to integration challenges
- Clean code architecture
- Strong error handling design
- Creative solutions for type conversion

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

1. **Integration Takes Time**: Even with good interfaces, integration revealed edge cases
2. **Monitoring First**: Team 1's approach of building monitoring early paid off
3. **Type Safety**: Adapters were crucial for maintaining clean boundaries
4. **Communication**: Daily syncs prevented major misalignments

## 🚀 Demo Readiness Assessment

### Ready ✅
- Infrastructure and connection management
- Basic request routing
- Storage and retrieval
- Monitoring dashboards

### Almost Ready 🏗️
- Async request processing
- Progress updates (intermittent)
- Error handling

### At Risk ⚠️
- Multiple concurrent async requests
- Progress batching
- Performance under load

### Demo Strategy
1. Focus on happy path with one async request
2. Show monitoring and observability
3. Demonstrate error handling
4. Keep load testing as "future work"

---

## 🎉 Celebrations

- Team 1 delivered 100% of commitments!
- Integration worked on first try (mostly)
- No major architectural issues discovered
- Both teams supported each other well

## 📅 Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 4 hours)
1. Fix progress update reliability
2. Complete ReportHandler
3. Run end-to-end test
4. Prepare demo environment

### Week 3 Preview
- Client SDK development
- Performance optimization
- Additional handlers
- Production deployment

Remember: We've built something impressive in just 2 weeks! The demo will showcase real async processing with progress updates - a complex system that many teams take months to build.
