# Streamer Metrics Directory

This directory contains baseline metrics and measurement tools for the Streamer project, particularly focused on measuring the impact of Lift framework integration.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To collect baseline metrics:

```bash
./metrics/baseline/scripts/run_baseline_collection.sh
```

This will:
1. Check for required tools (gocloc, gocyclo, bc, python3)
2. Collect code quality metrics
3. Run performance benchmarks
4. Analyze Lift integration opportunities
5. Generate comprehensive reports

## 📊 Baseline Metrics (June 13, 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Lines of Code | 20,476 |
| Test Coverage | 69.1% |
| Average Lambda Size | 11.41 MB |
| Average Cold Build | 17.70s |
| Test Execution Time | 51.72s |

## 🛠️ Collection Scripts

- **`run_baseline_collection.sh`** - Master script that orchestrates all metrics collection
- **`collect_code_metrics.sh`** - Analyzes code quality, complexity, and test coverage
- **`collect_performance_benchmarks.sh`** - Measures build times and test performance
- **`analyze_lift_opportunities.sh`** - Identifies specific areas for Lift integration

## 📈 Post-Integration Comparison

After Lift integration, run the same scripts to compare:
- Expected 35% reduction in lines of code
- Expected 40% improvement in cold start times
- Expected 30% reduction in bundle sizes

## 🔧 Required Tools

- `gocloc` - For counting lines of code
- `gocyclo` - For cyclomatic complexity analysis
- `bc` - For arithmetic calculations
- `python3` - For data processing and report generation

Install missing tools:
```bash
go install github.com/hhatto/gocloc/cmd/gocloc@latest
go install github.com/fzipp/gocyclo/cmd/gocyclo@latest
brew install bc python3
```

## 📝 Notes

- Baseline metrics exclude the `examples/` directory
- All metrics are collected locally without requiring AWS deployment
- Raw data is preserved for future analysis
- Results are timestamped for historical comparison
