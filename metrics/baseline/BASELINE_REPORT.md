# Streamer Baseline Metrics Report

**Generated:** June 13, 2025  
**Purpose:** Pre-Lift integration baseline for measuring improvement  

## Executive Summary

This report establishes comprehensive baseline metrics for the Streamer project before Lift framework integration. All metrics were collected through local analysis to provide a clear comparison point for post-integration improvements.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | Baseline Value | Target Post-Lift |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 20,476 | ~13,309 (-35%) |
| **Test Coverage** | 69.1% | >80% |
| **Average Lambda Size** | 11.41 MB | <8 MB |
| **Average Cold Build Time** | 17.70s | <10s |
| **Test Execution Time** | 51.72s | <30s |

## ðŸŽ¯ Lift Integration Opportunities

### Boilerplate Analysis
- **Error Handling:** 1,000+ `if err != nil` statements
- **Lambda Initialization:** ~20 lines per lambda
- **Context Propagation:** Manual in every function
- **Logging:** Inconsistent patterns across handlers

### Estimated Improvements with Lift
1. **Code Reduction:** ~35% (7,166 lines)
   - Lambda initialization: 80 lines
   - Error handling simplification: ~3,000 lines
   - Middleware consolidation: 200 lines
   - Removed boilerplate: ~3,886 lines

2. **Performance Gains:**
   - Cold start reduction: 40% (from manual init to Lift's optimized boot)
   - Bundle size reduction: 30% (better tree shaking)
   - Memory usage reduction: 15% (efficient middleware)

3. **Quality Improvements:**
   - Standardized error handling
   - Consistent logging with correlation IDs
   - Built-in metrics and tracing
   - Simplified testing with Lift's test utilities

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies Analysis

- **Direct Dependencies:** 76
- **Indirect Dependencies:** 0 (all resolved)
- **Key Dependencies:**
  - AWS SDK v2 (multiple services)
  - AWS Lambda Go runtime
  - JWT handling
  - UUID generation
  - Testing frameworks

## ðŸš€ Recommendations for Lift Integration

### Priority Order
1. **Connect Handler** - High impact, moderate complexity
2. **Disconnect Handler** - Low complexity, quick win  
3. **Router Handler** - Highest complexity, high impact
4. **Processor Handler** - Moderate complexity, high impact

### Focus Areas
1. **Middleware Stack Implementation**
   - JWT validation
   - Request/response logging
   - Error handling
   - Metrics collection

2. **WebSocket Adapter Development**
   - Critical for API Gateway WebSocket compatibility
   - Needs early validation with Lift team

3. **Configuration Management**
   - Migrate from environment variables to Lift's config system
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Maintain current 69.1% coverage minimum
   - Target 80%+ with Lift's testing utilities
   - Focus on integration tests for middleware

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Criteria

Post-Lift integration should achieve:

- âœ… 35% reduction in lines of code
- âœ… 40% improvement in cold start times  
- âœ… 30% reduction in bundle sizes
- âœ… Test coverage â‰¥80%
- âœ… Zero increase in error rates
- âœ… Simplified debugging with correlation IDs
- âœ… Automated metrics and tracing

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

1. **Share this baseline** with the Lift team
2. **Set up Lift dependencies** in development environment
3. **Create WebSocket adapters** for Lift compatibility
4. **Begin Connect handler migration** as proof of concept
5. **Establish CI/CD pipeline** for gradual rollout
