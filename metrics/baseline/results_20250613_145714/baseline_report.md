## Executive Summary

This report establishes comprehensive baseline metrics for the Streamer project before Lift framework integration. All metrics were collected through local analysis without requiring AWS deployment.

### Key Findings

- **Test Coverage:** 67.1%
- **Dependencies:** 78 direct, 0 indirect
- **Average Lambda Size:** 11.42MB
- **Average Cold Build Time:** 17.69s
- **Estimated Code Reduction with Lift:** 35%

## Code Quality Metrics

*See raw_data/cloc_metrics_*.txt for detailed breakdown*

## Performance Benchmarks

*See raw_data/performance_benchmarks_*.txt for detailed results*

## Lift Integration Opportunities

*See raw_data/lift_opportunities_*.md for comprehensive analysis*


## Recommendations

Based on the baseline analysis:

1. **Prioritize Connect Handler** for initial Lift migration (moderate complexity, high impact)
2. **Focus on middleware consolidation** to achieve quick wins in code reduction
3. **Implement comprehensive testing** during migration to maintain coverage levels
4. **Create WebSocket adapters** early to mitigate compatibility risks

## Next Steps

1. Share this baseline report with the Lift team
2. Set up development environment with Lift dependencies
3. Begin Day 1 tasks per the integration plan
4. Use these metrics to measure post-integration improvements
