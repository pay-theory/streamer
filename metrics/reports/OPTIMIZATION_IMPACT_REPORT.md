## üöÄ Recommendations

### Immediate Focus Areas

1. **Router Lambda Deep Dive**
   - 53.9% build time increase needs investigation
   - 43.6% bundle size increase suggests architectural issue
   - Consider partial rollback or alternative approach

2. **Cold Start Optimization**
   - Profile initialization code
   - Consider lazy loading strategies
   - Review Lift configuration for cold start optimization

3. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Implement aggressive tree shaking
   - Analyze dependency inclusion
   - Consider lambda-specific optimization

### Strategic Decisions

1. **Framework Trade-offs**
   - Accept performance cost for maintainability benefits
   - Focus on developer experience improvements
   - Measure operational benefits (observability, debugging)

2. **Incremental Approach**
   - Consider rolling back Router lambda to baseline
   - Keep optimized lambdas (Disconnect, Processor)
   - Gradual re-implementation with lessons learned
